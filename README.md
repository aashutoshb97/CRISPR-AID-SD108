# CRISPR-AID-gRNA-design
Guide RNA design for 3 orthogonal Cas9 for Activation, Inteference and Deletion for Issatchenkia Orientalis (SD108).
SD108 genome sequences obtained from JGI [130 scaffolds]

The repository contains codes for constructing genePred table which is input file for gRNA design using CHOPCHOP and the AID codes for respective Cas9's.
